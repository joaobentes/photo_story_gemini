# Project Title: Gemini Story Generator

This project is a Flutter application that uses the Gemini API to generate story intros. The user inputs an image and an author's name, and the Gemini API returns a story intro based on these inputs.

at Sciova. You can join us for this session to see how we complete the integration. Here is the [link to the meetup](https://www.meetup.com/gdgwestsweden/events/301214985/?utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=share-btn_savedevents_share_modal&utm_source=link).
